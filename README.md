# How it works?
Before starting the project you need to make some changes into the project.

## In the .NET project:
1. In **StartUp.cs** you need to add the connection string to your database
2. Run the `dotnet ef database update` command in order to add the migrations into your database
3. Start the project

## In the React project:
1. run `npm install` to install the node modules
2. run `yarn start` to start the project
